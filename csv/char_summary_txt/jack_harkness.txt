"Captain Jack Harkness" was the alias adopted by a Time Agent and con man from the 51st century who became an associate and occasional companion of the Doctor.

After he was killed by a Dalek, he was revived by Rose Tyler, who at the time was transformed into a nearly omnipotent being. Unable to control her powers, she accidentally turned him into an immortal being. Because of this, the Ninth Doctor saw his companion as a fixed point — a temporal paradox that threatened the TARDIS' proper operation. Consequently, the Doctor abandoned him in the year 200,100 aboard a space station.

Stranded, the former Time Agent had to use his own devices to catch up to the Doctor, thinking it likely that he'd find the Ninth Doctor in the early 21st century (as that was Rose's home era). But his vortex manipulator failed to deliver him there due to the damage caused when he was exterminated by the Daleks, missing by more than a century — and going on the fritz immediately thereafter. This left the immortal no choice but to simply wait from the mid-19th to the early 21st century to reconnect with the Doctor.

During his long wait for Doctor, he worked for Torchwood Three the majority of those years. For several decades an informal freelancer, he eventually became its head in the year 2000. Later that decade, he finally met up with the Doctor, now regenerated as the Tenth Doctor and travelling with Martha Jones.

At the dawn of the 2010s, the alien species know as The 456 returned to Earth. Although Torchwood was able to repel the threat, their success came at the loss of their physical headquarters and painful personal loss for Jack. He therefore disbanded the group and left Earth. However, he returned during the events of the so-called "Miracle Day", and a new Torchwood team arose.
