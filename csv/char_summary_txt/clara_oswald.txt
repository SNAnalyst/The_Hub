Clara Oswald was a companion to the Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors. According to the former, she was "not possible" due to their meetings previously in his personal timeline, with two such encounters seeing her die. Though assured by the empathic psychic Emma Grayling and the TARDIS scanner that Clara was just an "ordinary girl", the Doctor couldn't believe that to be true and thought her to be "the only mystery worth solving."
