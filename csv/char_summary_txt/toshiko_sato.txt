Toshiko "Tosh" Sato applied her scientific skills to the Torchwood Three team, after having worked for the Ministry of Defence. Beautiful, brilliant and insecure, much of Tosh's private life remained mysterious even after her death. She lost her life after enduring severe blood loss from a gunshot inflicted by Gray, but before the wound claimed her life, she fought on long enough to help Owen Harper save Cardiff from a nuclear disaster, even though it cost him his life as well.
