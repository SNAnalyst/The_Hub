Ianto Jones was an ex-member of the ill-fated Torchwood One and a member of Torchwood Three, initially serving as more a "support man" or "tea boy", but later took a more active role in missions. He first approached Captain Jack Harkness with enthusiasm about joining the team, eventually winning him over. Ianto soon became integral to the group, though his attempts to shroud his past impacted them in a bad way. He later fell in love with Jack and became his romantic partner.

However, Ianto met an early demise as part of a mass murder instigated by the 456 ambassador when it spread a deadly virus through Thames House. Following Ianto's death, the after-effects would leave Jack riddled with guilt and grief, ultimately spelling the end of Torchwood Three.
