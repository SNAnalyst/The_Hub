Emerging from his previous incarnation's explosive regeneration on Trenzalore, the Twelfth Doctor was the first incarnation of the Doctor's second regeneration cycle, bestowed upon him by the Time Lords at Clara Oswald's urging.

Assured of the survival of Gallifrey, the Doctor was no longer chained down by guilt, becoming a less amiable character with a withdrawn attitude who habitually questioned his own goodness. Although he was no stranger to kindness and humour, the Twelfth Doctor often dispensed with niceties in a tense situation, becoming cold and calculative in critical moments that required sound judgment and the occasional application of sharp practice.

However, because of his detachment from emotions, he could come off as unpleasant, fearsome, and ruthless. He became harder to trust, and acknowledged his shift toward negative personality traits, feeling incensed and fearful at what he was changing into. However, after resolving his morality crisis, he started to show his lighter side more clearly and started to show the more positive traits of his character, until Clara's death caused him to return to his more cynical nature. After having his memory of her removed, however, the Doctor's jovial side mixed into his cynical nature to form a stable personality.

Unique amongst his incarnations, the Twelfth Doctor would not travel full time with the large majority of his companions, with some like Clara Oswald and Bill Potts taking breaks from the TARDIS between travels, some like Hattie Munroe taking the occasional trip, and some like Jata being involved in various side quests during a longer trip.

The Twelfth Doctor was also known to go long periods of time in one location, such as the town of Краснодар, his confession dial, 1970s Brixton, Darillium and St Luke's University.
