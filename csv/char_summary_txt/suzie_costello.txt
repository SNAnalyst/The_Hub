Suzie Costello was a member of Torchwood Three in the early 21st century up until late 2007 when she committed suicide.

Although she wasn't alone in having used Torchwood-acquired technology to her own advantage, she had been the most destructive. Suzie, unlike her other teammates, had malicious ulterior motives and carried them out through secret gambits. Despite her troubled life, she harbored a sadistic cruelty that led to her early demise. However, Suzie's influence continued to cause bedlam after her death, through a plan to resurrect herself should she perish, which was eventually undone. She would be revived yet another time by alien technology, only to face a final death beyond any hope of return.
