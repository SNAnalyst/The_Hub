Amelia Jessica "Amy" Pond - sometimes styled Amelia Williams after her marriage - was the first companion of the Doctor in his eleventh incarnation. She was the girlfriend and later wife of nurse Rory Williams, and the mother of Melody Pond, who later became known as River Song. Amy died aged 87 at some point prior to 2012 after allowing a Weeping Angel to send her back in time, hoping to be reunited with her husband. She was buried beside Rory in a graveyard in New York City.
