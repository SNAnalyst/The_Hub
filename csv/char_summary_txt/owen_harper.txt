Owen Harper was Torchwood Three's chief medical officer during a portion of the 2000s. Moody and forthright, Harper wasn't slow to show his dissatisfaction with Jack Harkness' decisions. After being shot and killed by Aaron Copley, Owen was brought back to life briefly by Jack with the resurrection gauntlet. After Death itself tried to use Owen as a vessel to manifest, Owen was restored fully in a state of "living death". In this state he couldn't heal himself, and wasn't considered to be actually alive. He later died again, this time for good after being exposed to a large amount of radiation but not before accepting his true feelings for Toshiko Sato.
