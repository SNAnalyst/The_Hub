Torchwood: Children of Earth was a 5-part miniseries that took place over the course of 5 consecutive days.

Day One was the first episode of the third series of Torchwood. It marked the beginning of the end for the Torchwood Institute as it had been established over the course of two series by eliminating almost all of its technological resources. It saw two great losses: the destruction of the Torchwood 3 headquarters and the theft of their trademark vehicle. Gwen Cooper also discovered she had recently become pregnant, a discovery which was soon followed by one of Captain Jack Harkness's most gratuitous deaths to date.

Day Two was the second episode in the third series of Torchwood. It was significant for showing the extent of Jack Harkness' regeneration ability, as he survived being blown apart.

Day Three was the third episode of the third series of Torchwood. It notably introduced the 456 after the buildup in previous episodes. Torchwood Three also established a new temporary base of operations and pilfered a new car to replace their stolen SUV.

Day Four was the penultimate episode of Children of Earth. Narratively, it was most notable for revealing the true threat of the 456 and for killing off Ianto Jones.

Day Five concluded Torchwood: Children of Earth. It marked the death of the 456 and resolution of the five day crisis. Afterwards, Jack departed from Earth, officially disbanding Torchwood Three, leaving Gwen Cooper and Rhys Williams a safe world to raise their baby in; because this branch was the only one known to still be operational, it meant Torchwood as a whole effectively ceased to exist.

Notable trivia: This story featured the second appearance of Peter Capaldi portraying a character within the Doctor Who universe. He previously had the role of Caecilius in the story The Fires of Pompeii, and would later play the Doctor himself - specifically, the Twelfth Doctor.
