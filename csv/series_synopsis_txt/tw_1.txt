The first Series of Torchwood premiered in 2006. It saw the introduction of Torchwood Three and its respective team (Jack Harkness, Owen Harper, Toshiko Sato, Ianto Jones, Suzie Costello, and later Gwen Cooper).

The series ties into Series 1, 2, and 3 of Doctor Who, with references to the Bad Wolf meme and Harold Saxon, as well as the presence of the severed hand which once belonged to the Tenth Doctor. Most of the stories are contemporary, but the series delves into flashbacks and the occasional time travel adventures centred mainly around Jack Harkness.

Torchwood established a much grittier and adult nature than its parent series; later series would somewhat downplay these controversial elements.
