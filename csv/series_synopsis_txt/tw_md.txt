One day, nobody dies. All across the world, nobody dies. And then the next day, and the next, and the next. People keep ageing. They get hurt and sick, but they never die. The populace of the planet dub this "Miracle Day" for the immortality they now seem to have. However, this leads to a negative result: a population boom, overnight. With all the extra people unable to die and continuing births, resources have become limited. It's suggested that in four months' time, the human race will cease to be viable. But this can't be a natural event – someone must have caused "Miracle Day". It's a race against time as C.I.A. agent Rex Matheson investigates a global conspiracy. The answers lie within an old, secret British institute. As Rex keeps asking “What is Torchwood?", he's drawn into a world of adventure, and a threat to change what it means to be human, forever.

The answers seem to lie within Torchwood itself. But Torchwood (3rd branch) was destroyed, years ago, and the keys to the institute are held by its only two surviving agents: former Police Officer Gwen Cooper, who has long since disappeared along with her husband and child, and the mysterious Captain Jack Harkness, a man whose history seems to stretch back for centuries and has disappeared off the face of the earth.

Things become even more complicated as Rex soon becomes one of the people continuing to live thanks to "Miracle Day". Luckily, Gwen comes out of hiding and Jack returns to Earth to help. Combining their experience with bizarre situations and information gathered from one of Rex's contacts, a new Torchwood team takes shape.

Adding to the bizarre circumstances, Jack has lost his immortality, and begins to think that something from his past may be causing "Miracle Day".
