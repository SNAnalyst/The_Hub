The main story arc for the Series 2 was the Torchwood Institute, referenced only twice previously, which served to lead up to the final episodes as well as the Torchwood spinoff series. A secondary arc dealt with the development of the love story between Rose and the Doctor. The Series 2 finale saw the introduction of Donna Noble.
