The second Series of Torchwood saw James Marsters appear as Captain John Hart, and included glimpses of the 51st century and the First World War. Freema Agyeman guest starred as Martha Jones for 3 episodes.

Series 2 saw the deaths of two major characters (it's not typical for Torchwood agents to live past their mid-30's).

In terms of the crossover of timelines in Doctor Who and Torchwood, it should be noted that the final three episodes of Doctor Who Series 3 take place between the Torchwood Series 1 finale and its Series 2 premiere.
