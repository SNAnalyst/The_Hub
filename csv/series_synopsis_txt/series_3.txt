Series 3 of Doctor Who saw David Tennant joined by Freema Agyeman as Martha Jones for most of the series' episodes.

Predominated by a story arc that dealt with the mystery of Harold Saxon, a British politician who turned out to be the Master, the series also involved the return of Jack Harkness. Because Jack's involvement in the series was narratively important to Torchwood, the series had a demonstrable impact on Series 1 and Series 2 of that sister programme.
