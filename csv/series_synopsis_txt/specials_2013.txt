The 2013 specials of Doctor Who are two additional episodes following the programme's seventh Series. In addition to the traditional Christmas episode, which has been a feature of the revived series since 2005, there was also a special celebrating the 50th anniversary of the programme.

Both episodes starred Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and Jenna Coleman as Clara Oswald. The 50th anniversary special, "The Day of the Doctor" saw the guest returns of former series leads David Tennant and Billie Piper. The 2013 Christmas special, "The Time of the Doctor", saw the departure of Smith from the series and the introduction of Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor.
