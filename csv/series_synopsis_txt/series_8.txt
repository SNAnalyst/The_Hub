Series 8 saw the debut of Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor; he was joined by Jenna Coleman as Clara Oswald as primary companion throughout the entire run. The overarching story elements revolve around characters who have died being greeted to "Heaven" by a woman named Missy, where the heaven is revealed to be a data cloud to store the minds of the deceased, as Missy (The Master) upgrades the bodies into Cybermen before manipulating the minds to delete their emotions and put them into their old cyber-upgraded bodies as an army. This is a plan to lure the Doctor into a trap so she can get her "friend back."
