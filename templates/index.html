Alright. So what needs to go on this page?

* Character names/img_url (will be in carousel eventually, list for now)
  (alphabetical? by character type?)
* Series names/img_url IN ORDER

-->

<!--

The above is what I need to get displayed on here today. (5/16)

Future items:

* Navbar
* Search
* Login/acct creation
*
