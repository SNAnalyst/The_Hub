<!--
Need to build out this template to display user info
Would be cool at some point to include favorites & whatnot
For now, just email...and go from there


TO DO: Upon registration, have user already automatically signed in?
Or, at least display a message to indicate they must log in
-->

{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}

  <p><b>User Email: </b>{{ user.email}}</p>
  <p>(Some content here, TBD)</p>

{% endblock %}
