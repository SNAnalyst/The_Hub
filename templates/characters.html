(obviously we'll get to a point where we have a pretty template to swap individual characters in and out of)

  {% for character in characters %}
    <h3>{{ character.char_name }}</h3>
    <p>{{ character.image_1 }}<p>
    <p><b>Portrayed by:</b> {{ character.actor }}</p>
    <p><b>Character Summary:</b> {{ character.char_summary }}
  {% endfor %}
